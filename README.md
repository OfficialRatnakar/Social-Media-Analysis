# Social Media Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project analyzes extensive social media user data from Instagram to provide actionable insights for marketing strategies aimed at increasing user engagement, retention, and acquisition. Leveraging multi-dimensional datasets covering user behaviors, posts, tags, comments, likes, and follower relationships, the analysis highlights key trends and user segmentation to guide data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes information from the following tables:

- **Users**: Demographics and activity status of users, including active and inactive users.
- **Photos**: Data on all photos uploaded by users.
- **Comments**: Records of user comments on photos.
- **Likes**: Tracks which users liked which photos.
- **Follows**: Tracks follower-followee relationships.
- **Tags**: Unique tags associated with photos.
- **Photo Tags**: Mapping between photos and tags.

The data spans various user activity levels, from inactive users to highly active and engaged ones. It captures user engagement metrics, posting habits, and tag usage patterns, providing a holistic view of platform dynamics.

## Key Insights

- **User Activity Distribution**: A significant portion of users are inactive or have low content interaction, highlighting potential retention challenges.
- **Posting Behavior**: Only a minority of users are highly active in posting and tagging photos.
- **Tag Engagement**: Certain tag categories like "Party Fun," "Landscape," and "Joy-Emotions" show higher engagement, indicating their popularity and influence in driving user interaction.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Engagement level positively correlates with the number of posts; however, very high post frequency does not always equate to higher engagement.
- **User Segmentation**: Users are effectively segmented by activity and engagement levels, aiding targeted marketing and content strategy.
